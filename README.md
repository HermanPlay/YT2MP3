# Telegram Bot for Downloading Music from YouTube

This Telegram bot is designed to make it easy and convenient for users to download their favorite music from YouTube links. The bot is built using the Telegram Bot API and can process YouTube links that are sent to it. It utilizes a third-party library to download the audio from the YouTube videos and then sends the downloaded file directly to the user via Telegram. 

## Getting Started

To use the bot, simply send a YouTube link to the bot in a private message. The bot will automatically download the audio from the video and send it to you via Telegram. You can also send a message with a playlist or album link and the bot will download all the songs from that playlist or album.

## Installation

To deploy the bot, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git or download the ZIP file.
2. Create a new bot on Telegram by talking to the BotFather and getting your bot token.
3. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Update the `config.py` file with your bot token and other settings as needed.
5. Run the bot using the command `python bot.py`.

## Usage

To use the bot, simply send a YouTube link to the bot in a private message. The bot will automatically download the audio from the video and send it to you via Telegram. You can also send a message with a playlist or album link and the bot will download all the songs from that playlist or album.
